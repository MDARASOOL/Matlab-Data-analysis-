Descriptions of the data of first three files can be found from the link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds. You can download the data ﬁle seeds dataset.txt by clicking on Data Folder on the webpage. 

data or file image_comperession using pca can be found at http://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=misc&image=22#top.
 (the stream and bridge image is compressed)
 
 The data that used in file datavisualization using pca can be found at http://inverseprobability.com/3PhaseData.html. This 12-dimensional data set is from a physics-based simulation of a non-invasive monitoring system, used to determine the quantity of oil in a multi-phase pipeline containing a mixture of oil, water and gas. 
 
 svm(cmd-PROMT) FILE,the software used is LibSVM . The type of SVM used is the C-SVC (Cost-Support Vector Classiﬁer) and the kernel function used is the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF).
